# UpSet plots: A way of presenting multiple indicators of demographic change

# Introduction
Here I provide the data and code for replicating the findings presented in the data visualization that showcases UpSet plots as a way of presenting multiple demographic indicators.

# Data 
## All data are county-level and were extracted using the US Census API
* We developed a function to pull different vintages of the ACS to allow for comparison of indicators.
* All data are compiled at the county-level
* UpSet plot allows for the visualization of counties that exhibit similar manifestations of these indicators.

# Code
The code included in this repository produced the visualization and supporting tabulations.
